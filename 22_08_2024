Write a Java program to reverse an array of integers in place. The program should not use any additional arrays.

let a=[2,3,4,5,6]
console.log(a.reverse())

Write a Java program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".



let a=[1,2,3,4,5]

for(i=0;i<a.length;i++){
  
  if(a[i]%3===0){
    a[i]="fizz"
  }if(a[i]%5===0){
    a[i]="buzz"
  }if(a[i]%3===0&&a[i]%5===0){
    a[i]="fizzbuzz"
  }
}
console.log(a)



Write a program that calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers. The value of N should be input by the user.



let a=[1,2,3,4,5]
let b=0

for(i=0;i<a.length;i++){
  
  if(a[i]>0){
  a[i]+b
  }}
console.log(b)


Create a program that calculates the factorial of a number provided by the user.

function factorial(n) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(factorial(5));
